This is a patch for the present patch of SSB Alt Universe to provide Smash 3C textures.

At the build it is based on is a demo/in progress I cannot promise it will run flawlessly. If you see an error, be sure to check the base build first. I make no promises to keep this build regularly updated or supported in the future.

Instructions to install:

Find the pf file and merge and override the files

For Dolphin that is located in: 

SSB Alternate Universe Demo v0.85\Dolphin-x64\User\Load\Riivolution\private\wii\app\RSBE
